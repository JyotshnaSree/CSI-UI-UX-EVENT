# CSI-UI-UX-EVENT
This web-based tool is built for CSI events at Raghu Engineering College. Participants select a mystery number to reveal a hidden project or challenge assigned to them. It adds a fun, fair, and creative twist to project-based competitions like UI/UX challenges, hackathons, and ideathons.
